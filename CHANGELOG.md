# Changelog

Notable changes to `@goodandready/dsh-vision-bridge`.

## 0.6.5

### Fixed
- Settings no longer wait on the removed settingsScope service. The client uses configForms (#350).

## 0.6.4

### Fixed
- **Settings reachable again on the plugin's own page**: the current DSH core
  (0.1.6-alpha.2) renders a plugin's configuration page only for entries registered
  in the plugin-list seat `plugins.item`. `VisionCard` (under its error boundary) is
  now registered there too (`id: 'dsh-vision-bridge'`, order 60, static label); the
  row seat and the legacy `settings.plugin.item` card stay as fallbacks.

## 0.6.3

### Fixed
- **Settings reachable again**: the card registered into `settings.plugin.item`, a
  slot the current DSH core (0.1.6-alpha.2) no longer renders, so the plugin's
  settings were unreachable. The surface now registers into the Plugins page row
  seat `plugins.row.config`, keyed `@goodandready/dsh-vision-bridge#dsh-vision-bridge`
  (`rowConfigKey(package, rowId)`): the plugin's row gains a configure control whose
  page is the settings form (`view: 'page'`, open and without our card header — the
  host page draws the title, icon, crumb and padding) plus a one-line state for
  `view: 'summary'`. The legacy seat stays registered as a fallback for older cores.

### Added
